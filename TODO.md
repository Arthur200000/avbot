TODOs
===
Here are the TODOs:

- [ ] Build support for minecraft chats
  - [ ] See repo [Arthur200000/avbot-bukkit](https://github.com/Arthur200000/avbot-bukkit), a fork of RoyalIRC.
    - [ ] Remove Extra IRC processes like listen, kick which should be handled by avbot itself.
  - [ ] ~Make a IRC interface to simply let other apps dump their outputs to avbot~ Well we have an RPC.
  - [ ] Also make some kinds of extensions interface so we can probably use commands like `.qqbot mc /ban someone` to send messages back to the extension.
  - [ ] Java binding
